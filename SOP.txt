Statement of Purpose
I have been interested in Artificial Intelligence since high school. My career goal is to become an AI Applied Scientist.

I grew up in a family full of engineers and investors focusing on AI and robotics. I translated 'The Tao of Startups: A guidebook for your entrepreneurial life' which was published by Posts&Telecom Press-one of the top China publishers, in 2020. After talking with many entrepreneurs in AI startups about the industry state and technique challenges, I realized that AI has gone through several cycles and is now in the stage of large-scale commercialization. My passion to learn AI has been strengthened brick by brick, and therefore, chose Computer Science and Technology with  specialist area of AI as my major in my undergraduate studies. 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked diligently and got a GPA of 3.88/4.0, demonstrating my outstanding mathematics and computer-related abilities. To build a solid AI knowledge foundation and stay up to date with its latest technologies, I enrolled in online courses and actively joined a number of AI groups, such as the DL group and the accelerated first-order algorithm in ML group organized by the China Society of Image and Graphics. I efficiently learned the state-of-the-art AI algorithms, theories, and future directions by interchanging with industry veterans.

Following my passion for scientific research, I utilized AI to prevent diabetes from becoming more prevalent among young people from February 2022 to December 2022. It was the first time I stepped into the cutting-edge field of AI. Specifically, after outlining potential solutions based on the crux of the problems, I established a medical knowledge graph centered on diabetes and created a subsequent automatic question-answering software. The knowledge graph was developed in Python, and the software was implemented in HTML, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies. In this challenging project, my strong mathematical and research abilities were positive assets to my work. I also applied for software copyright for this project.

While participating in the study activities of AI groups and working on research projects, I discovered that datasets often have high dimensions that lead to the issue of the 'curse of dimensionality. Thus, I have been exploring feature selection to descend dimensions since June 2022. In order to determine the sub-research direction, I read more than 300 relevant papers, which expanded my grasp of this field. As a result, I found that labels are precious. I specifically chose the unsupervised feature selection direction. I further explored the subspace clustering feature selection methods, which focus on datasets' geometric and topological characteristics that match the unsupervised feature selection. To better discover the technique's innovative point, I wrote a review paper summarizing the present subspace clustering feature selection algorithms, application scenarios, and future directions. Further, I reproduced the mainstream subspace clustering feature selection algorithms employing Matlab and designed my novel algorithm. Currently, I am implementing the algorithm and plan to publish a journal paper in the first half of 2023. 

During my research experiences, I wondered how to transform research outcomes into products and proved the product value to real users. So I decided to work as an algorithm developer in a collaborative robot high-tech company named Realman Intelligent Technology. Firstly, I analyzed the kinematics algorithms. Considering the CPU's limited computing capacity and memory constraints, I eventually selected the seven-segment S-type acceleration and deceleration method, which could make the mechanical arm more flexible in the Cartesian space and reduce the negative effect of the motion planning algorithm on the arm's position and attitude. Secondly, during the implementation process, I discovered apparent gaps between the ideal method and actual performance, such as rounding error. To solve these issues, I studied related papers and tried different methods. Finally, using the C language, I successfully deployed the method to increase the robot arm's flexibility and robustness. This internship inspired my research aspirations further.

The MScAC program can provide me with a cluster of world-class AI faculty researching cutting-edge technologies that play a central role in improving AI. Establishing strong relationships among businesses and researchers, the MScAC program can give me internship opportunities. I am interested in the AI direction of the MScAC program because I have gradually learned about AI since high school, and now I am obsessed with it. And AI has now reached the stage of commercialization, and my research experience is a solid foundation for my development in the AI direction. My career goal is to become an AI Applied Scientist who does scientific research with a focus on implementing solutions at scale in the real world. My previous internship and research experience in the field of artificial intelligence made me excited about the research work based on the actual needs of products. In my career life, I will produce more beneficial and useful output. Based on the above reasons, I firmly believe that I am the best candidate for this program
